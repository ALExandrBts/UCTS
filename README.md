## Turning Waste into Affordable Energy Storage

UCTS (Upcycled Ceramic Thermal Storage) is an innovative solution that converts industrial waste materials (red mud and microsilica) into high-performance ceramic thermal storage blocks for renewable energy applications. Our technology addresses two critical global challenges: high energy storage costs and industrial waste pollution.

---

## Problem Statement

### High Energy Storage Costs
Energy storage currently costs $150-$250/kWh, significantly slowing the adoption of renewable energy sources. This high cost barrier prevents many potential green energy projects from becoming economically viable.

### Massive Waste Pollution
The world generates 177.3 million tons of red mud and microsilica waste annually, with only 2-5% being recycled effectively. This waste pollutes land and water resources, causing significant environmental damage.

## The UCTS Solution

Our proprietary process transforms industrial waste into URC-1 ceramic material, which is then fabricated into upcycled thermal storage blocks specifically designed for energy storage applications.
